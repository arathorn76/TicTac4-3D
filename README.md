# TicTac4-3D
Tic Tac Toe like game. Played in a 3D cube of 4\*4\*4 cells. 4 in a row wins.

The purpose of this project is more of a "getting a feel for js" and "finally making myself familiar with git and github" than a working product.
Any input in any form is still welcome.
Plus itÂ´s a fun little game (imo) ;-)
